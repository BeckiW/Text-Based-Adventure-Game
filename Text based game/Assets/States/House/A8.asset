  storyText: 'Evesdropping


    You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky looking men. The tall, scrawny
    one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered arrow shooter, while the shorter
    dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen small glass bottles with grey liquid
    inside.


    The stout fellow finishes cranking a large valve (clockwise you notice) and then
    both men dash off with much haste.


    What to do?


    1. Quick, uncrank that valve, they were clearly up to no good.

    2. Chase the men.'
